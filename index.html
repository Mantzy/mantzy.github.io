                <p id="aboutme">I consider myself a hard working and reliable person. I work well under pressure and like to be part of a team but I am able to work on my own too. I was always interested about IT since I was a kid although first, I tried myself on the
                    field of Biology and was learning supraindividual biology at the university, but later came back to the world of computers again. I enjoy to keep focusing on multiple things at once and always looking for new solutions. I like to learn
                    and in IT you always have the opportunity to learn new things as it’s one of the most dynamically evolving industry.</p>
